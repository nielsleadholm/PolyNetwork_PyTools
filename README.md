# PolyNetwork_PyTools

Python code for helper functions to enable creating simple, hierarchical polychronous neural network models to investigate the emergence of feature binding. These helper functions were written to provide data that can easily interface with the SPIKE C++ simulator (https://github.com/OFTNAI/Spike). 

For an introduction to polychronous neural networks, see the paper "Polychronization: Computation With Spikes", Izhikevich, 2006 (https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spnet.htm)

For an introduction to the theory whereby polychronous neural networks might encode binding information, see the paper "The Emergence of Polychronization and Feature Binding in a Spiking Neural Network Model of the Primate Ventral Visual System", Eguchi, 2018 (http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-25960-001.html)
